BM_DIVIDED_MUSLIMS_DESC;Divided Muslims is an alternative history scenario for the Stamford Bridge date. In this scenario we find a heavily divided Middle East where many sultans are vying for supremacy of the region. This scenario starts with the Seljuks and their neighbours at war with the Byzantines to establish the Sultunate of Rum, but it is up to the muslims to work together to prevent the Byzantines from reclaiming their land. Only time will tell who will win this clash of fate.;Divided Muslims is an alternative history scenario for the Stamford Bridge date.
